This GitHub program is developed to fetch and aggregate commit statistics from all repositories belonging to a specific GitHub user. The program utilizes the GitHub API to list repositories and gather data about the commits made within the last 365 days. By leveraging pagination, it can handle large numbers of repositories—up to 1000—and efficiently process the commit data even for extensive codebases. The program’s ability to filter commits by date ensures that only the most relevant data, such as recent activity, is collected and analyzed.

The program is built with flexibility in mind, allowing users to input their GitHub username and access token, thereby increasing the rate limit and avoiding unauthorized access issues. The authentication process ensures smooth and continuous data retrieval without hitting GitHub’s stringent rate limits. The extracted commit data is then compiled and saved into a CSV file, where each row represents a repository and the corresponding number of commits made over the past year. This format is chosen for its compatibility with various data processing tools, making it easy to integrate with other software or analytics platforms.

The generated statistics file serves as an input for another program, which uses this data to create a comprehensive Commit Summary Report. This report can provide insights into the development activity across multiple projects, identify trends over time, and assess the productivity of contributors. By automating the data collection and formatting process, this program streamlines the workflow, allowing developers, project managers, and analysts to focus on interpreting the results rather than manually gathering and organizing the data. Overall, this program is a valuable tool for anyone needing to monitor and evaluate commit activity across multiple GitHub repositories.
